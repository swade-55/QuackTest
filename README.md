# README for Quacker Project (Microservices Architecture)

## Introduction
Quacker is a web-based microservices application that allows users to share short posts, known as "quacks". This README provides an overview of the project's structure and instructions for setting up and running the application in a microservices architecture.

## Microservices Architecture
The Quacker application is structured as a set of loosely coupled microservices. This architecture enhances the scalability, maintainability, and deployment flexibility of the application.

### Microservices Breakdown
- **User Service**: Handles user authentication, registration, and user-related data.
- **Quack Service**: Manages quack posts, including creation, deletion, and interaction with quacks.

## File Structure
- `index.html`, `signup.html`, `login.html`: Frontend HTML files for the main page, signup, and login.
- `index.js`: Frontend JavaScript handling user interactions on the main page.
- `quackService.js`: Microservice for handling quack-related requests.
- `quackDB.js`: Database interactions specific to quacks.
- `userService.js`: Microservice for user authentication and registration.
- `userDB.js`: Database interactions for user data.
- `SERVER.js`: Gateway server for routing requests to appropriate microservices.

## Requirements
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Docker (optional for containerization)
- Kubernetes (optional for orchestration)
- Internet connection (for fetching external resources)

## Setup
1. **Clone Repository**: Clone the code repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in the project directory.
3. **Configure MongoDB**: Set up a MongoDB database and update connection strings in `quackDB.js` and `userDB.js`.
4. **Microservices Deployment** (optional): Containerize each microservice using Docker and orchestrate them using Kubernetes for scalability and fault tolerance.

## Running the Application
1. **Start Microservices**: Each microservice should be started independently, either directly or through a container orchestration platform.
2. **Gateway Server**: Start the gateway server (`SERVER.js`) which routes requests to the appropriate microservices.
3. **Access the Application**: Open `http://localhost:3000` in a web browser.

## Usage
- **Signup/Login**: Use the signup form for registration. Log in with credentials.
- **Posting and Interacting with Quacks**: Logged-in users can create, like, and comment on quacks.

## Microservices Management
- Monitor each microservice independently.
- Scale services based on demand.
- Update or maintain services without affecting others.

## Notes
- The application requires careful management of network requests between services.
- Security should be a top priority, especially in handling user data and service communication.
- This architecture is suitable for cloud deployment and high-availability scenarios.

## Support
For issues or contributions, open an issue or pull request in the project's GitHub repository. For microservices-specific queries, refer to the documentation or comments within each service file.
